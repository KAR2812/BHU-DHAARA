भू-DHAARA is our attempt to make **rainwater harvesting simple and accessible for everyone**.  
It’s a multilingual mobile/web app that lets people quickly check the rooftop rainwater harvesting (RTRWH) and artificial recharge potential for their buildings or plots.  

This project was built for **Smart India Hackathon 2025** under Problem Statement **25065 – Smart Automation**, by **Team FireWall** 🔥.

## 📌 Problem We’re Solving  
Even though India has huge potential for rooftop rainwater harvesting, there’s still no easy-to-use tool where people can directly check how much water they can save or recharge. Most of the process is manual and requires experts.  

We wanted to change that.

## 💡 Our Solution – भू-DHAARA  
Our app aims to bring everything together in one place:  

- 🗺️ Select your **plot/rooftop area on a map**  
- 🌧️ Get insights from **rainfall & groundwater data**  
- 🧠 **AI/ML models** suggest feasibility and cost–benefit reports  
- 📑 Downloadable **PDF reports** for future reference  
- 🌐 Works in **multiple Indian languages**  
- 🔒 Simple and secure login with **OTP verification**
